Introduction
This guide provides a step-by-step introduction on how to run the provided code locally. The code consists of a React application using Material-UI components to create a user interface with features such as filtering, pagination, and user management.

Prerequisites
Before running the code locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
npm
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the code to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:


npm install
Run the Application

Start the development server:

npm start
This will run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

Key Files and Directories
src/: Contains the source code for the React application.
components/: Contains reusable React components.
App.tsx: The main application component.
index.tsx: The entry point of the application.
public/: Contains public assets such as index.html.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
npm run build: Builds the app for production.
npm run eject: Ejects the project from Create React App configuration.
Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:


npm test
This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Building for Production
To create a production build of the app, run:



npm run build
This will build the app for production to the build folder, correctly bundling React in production mode and optimizing the build for best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
